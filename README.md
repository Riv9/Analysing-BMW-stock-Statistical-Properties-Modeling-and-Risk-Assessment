# Analysing-BMW-stock-Statistical-Properties-Modeling-and-Risk-Assessment

This project provides an introductory analysis of BMW stock, focusing on its price dynamics and returns from January 2005 to November 2022. 

The study begins with a graphical analysis and descriptive statistics to examine key features of the asset. It then explores statistical properties, including non-normality, autocorrelation, and ARCH effects. Finally, the best-fitting model is identified, followed by a bootstrap-based hypothesis test for an ARCH(1) model. Forecasting and Value at Risk (VaR) analysis are also conducted to assess potential risks.

The project was conducted in collaboration with Tommaso Celani and Benedikt Scheid.
